    "- Create strings\n",
    "- Use Python lists, and their operators https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations\n",
    "- Use Python built-in string methods: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods\n",
    "- Use conditionals\n",
    "- Use loops\n",
    "- Format print statements\n",
